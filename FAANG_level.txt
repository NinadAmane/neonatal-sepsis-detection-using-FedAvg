üìÖ Roadmap & phases to elevate to FAANG-level

Here are phases you‚Äôll go through. Each phase has major deliverables & existing project changes.

Phase 0 ‚Äì Clean up & foundation (1 week)

Goal: Make your current prototype robust, well-documented, reproducible.

Changes to do:

Fix scripts so they follow relative paths, convert notebook to .py, as discussed earlier.

Add a well‚Äêwritten README.md explaining project goal, architecture, how to run.

Add requirements.txt with correct dependencies (including Docker if planning ahead).

Add basic unit tests (e.g., test_preprocess.py, test_split.py) to validate your preprocessing & splitting logic.

Add .gitignore and maybe license.

Why: A FAANG interviewer will check ‚ÄúIs this reproducible? Can you run it easily?‚Äù ‚Äî this phase makes your project polished.

Phase 1 ‚Äì Build the Microservices Architecture (2 weeks)

Goal: Transform the monolithic prototype into modular services as described (server, clients, frontend).

Changes to do:

Create a Coordinator Server (server.py): Write a FastAPI service with endpoints GET /get_global_model, POST /upload_weights, etc.

Create Hospital Client script (client.py) that acts like a hospital: fetch global model, train locally, send weights. Use environment variables/config so you can spin up multiple instances.

Refactor your existing FL code: the averaging logic moves into Server; clients hold training logic.

Create Frontend (Streamlit or React) that talks to server endpoint to get model/predict.

Write docker-compose.yml with three services: server, clients (3), frontend. Dockerfile for each.

Update README with ‚Äúdocker-compose up‚Äù instructions.

Why: Microservices + Docker + orchestration show you can build a system, not just code a script. It aligns with microservice architectures for ML detailed in industry posts.

Phase 2 ‚Äì Deployment & DevOps (2 weeks)

Goal: Make your services containerized and deployable. Add CI/CD basics.

Changes to do:

Write Dockerfile.server, Dockerfile.client, Dockerfile.frontend.

Write docker-compose.yml and test on your machine: docker-compose up --build.

Add GitHub Actions workflows: one to lint/build/test, one to push Docker images (you can use GitHub Container Registry) and optionally deploy locally.

Document how you would deploy to Kubernetes (you don‚Äôt need full K8s cluster necessarily, but you must show manifests or explain).

Add config for environment variables, secrets (even if dummy), logging.

Why: FAANG interviewers will assess ability to ‚Äúgo from code to deployment‚Äù. This phase shows you know DevOps for ML.

Phase 3 ‚Äì Monitoring, Versioning & Production concerns (2 weeks)

Goal: Add ML‚Äêspecific production touches: model registry, versioning, monitoring, drift detection.

Changes to do:

Integrate MLflow (or another model registry) for tracking experiments, model versions.

Extend coordinator server to load model versions: /get_model?version=....

Add monitoring instrumentation: e.g., FastAPI metrics (Prometheus) for latency and request count; optionally simple drift metric (input distribution change) example.

Add logging and error handling across services.

Document how you would roll back model versions or trigger retraining when metrics drop.

Update README with ‚ÄúProduction readiness‚Äù section: privacy, scalability, explainability (SHAP), ethical/medical constraints.

Why: Real systems aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúwe built model‚Äù. They handle versions, data drift, monitoring. That‚Äôs key for healthcare (medical domain) and high quality engineering.

Phase 4 ‚Äì Advanced enhancements (optional but impressive) (3+ weeks)

Goal: Go above and beyond to really make it standout.

Enhancements to consider:

Use Kubernetes manifests + Helm (instead of just docker-compose). If you have access to a cloud free tier (AWS/GCP/Azure), deploy it there.

Use feature store concept (even simple) or caching.

Add Explainability UI: show SHAP values or feature importance for each prediction in frontend.

Add Retraining pipeline: e.g., on new data availability, trigger retrain automatically. Possibly use Airflow or Argo.

Add Multi‚Äêtenant simulation: simulate 10 hospitals, each uploading weights.

Add Differential privacy / Secure Aggregation simulation (ethical ML).

Add HIPAA/GDPR compliance notes, anonymization of data, audit logs.

Add Benchmarking: performance tests with many concurrent predictions.

Why: These are the ‚Äúwow‚Äù features that can set you apart when applying or interviewing. They show depth, scalability, domain awareness.

üéØ Proposed changes to your existing project

Since you already have the prototype, here are what you should refactor/expand:

Move your current FL/baseline code into src/prototype/ folder (so you have a clear ‚Äúprototype‚Äù path).

Start new folder structure as described above (services, infra, etc) side‚Äêby‚Äêside in same repo (or as a branch).

Convert your scripts into microservices: train_local_model.py becomes part of client; federated_averaging.py becomes part of server.

Add Dockerfiles for all existing services.

Replace direct file loads of model in frontend with API calls to server.

Convert CLI/arg handling into config files/environments so multiple hospitals are easy.

Add tests for preprocessing & splitting (unit test).

Add GitHub Actions file.

Update README with system overview, architecture diagram, how to run via docker-compose.

Add directory infra/ with placeholder k8s manifests (simple, can be minimal).

Add monitoring stub code (e.g., a /metrics endpoint in FastAPI) for future production phase.

üìå What to do right away (today)

Write/update README.md describing your project goal, what you built, architecture to come.

Create Dockerfile.server (makes your Coordinator service) and verify minimal FastAPI server.

Create docker-compose.yml with server and single client to test end-to-end locally.

Refactor your existing code to live in service structure (make sure relative imports/paths are good).

Commit these changes to GitHub, tag it like v0.1-foundation.

‚úÖ Final advice

Take it step by step. You don‚Äôt need to understand Kubernetes fully on day one ‚Äî start with Docker + docker-compose.

For each phase, document what you added ‚Äî this documentation itself is interview gold.

When you talk to an interviewer, you‚Äôll say: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs my prototype, and here‚Äôs how I refactored it into a scalable microservices architecture with Docker, pipelines, monitoring, and a clear path to Kubernetes.‚Äù That will sound mature and engineer-level.

Keep your commits clean (feature branches, meaningful messages) ‚Äî show you treat it like a real engineering project.
